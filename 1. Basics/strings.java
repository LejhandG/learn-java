//What is a String?
//String is a sequence of characters
String a = "Hello World";
//Also to execute multiple lines in JShell use { and press enter and to end the program use } and press enter
//String concatenation
//When you use the + sign it helps to concatenate two strings
//Also note that strings are immune to everything
//Example:
int myInt = 10;
String myString = "Hello";
System.out.println(myString + myInt);
//So instead of giving an error it will print Hello10
//So what the string does it converts integer 10 into string 10
//And then joins both the strings as it has a + sign
//So it concatenates both
