//An expression is the code segment which is on the right side of the equals sign
//Example: 
int a = 10;
//So in this code 10 is the expression
int b = (10*1) + (5*2);
//So in this code (10*1) + (5*2) is the expression
int myFirstNumber = 35;
int mySecondNumber = 12;
int myThirdNumber = 6;
int myTotal = myFirstNumber + mySecondNumber + myThirdNumber;
//So now 35+12+6 would be stored in myTotal
myThirdNumber = myFirstNumber * 2;
//So now myThirdNumber is overwritten to 70
myTotal = myFirstNumber + mySecondNumber + myThirdNumber;
//So now the myTotal is 117
//PLEASE NOT JAVA IS CASE SENSITIVE SO THE VARIABLE NAME SHOULD BE SAME AS THE DECLARED
//Now we move to the next topic
